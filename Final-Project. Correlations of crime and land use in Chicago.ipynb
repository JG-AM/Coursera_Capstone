    "I would explore the correlations between the amount and types of crimes committed in a community area and the venues located there.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The relations between crime and socioeconomic conditions are unclear. Often there are contradictory reports on whether difficult economic conditions create more crime or whether a booming economy that increases the availability of money and goods promotes crime. Nevertheless, it is important to do not dismiss possible connections between the economy and crime. In this project, I will try to find if the crimes committed in community areas with similar socioeconomic have a relation with the land use. For example, let's suppose that  A and B are community areas with similar economic conditions, but area A is much safer than area B. I want to see if the types of venues in area A are similar to those in area B. If they are not similar, then study what types of venues are present in the safer environment.  The venues could be parks, liquor shops, restaurants among others. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, venues that reduce crime in one type of area do not necessarily affect crime in other types of areas.  One hypothesis here is that parks can be that kind of venue. In areas with a high rate of crime, social interactions can induce people to become criminals. Parks promote social interaction.  Therefore parks there contribute to crime. On the other hand, parks will not affect crime in areas with low rate crime. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project could help policymakers to design safer neighborhoods by building or closing venues to reduce crime. "
